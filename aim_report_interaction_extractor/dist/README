To make this executable, I used the pyinstaller library.  Steps to reproduce this executable are:
1. In a python console execute `pip install pyinstaller`
2. Start a PowerShell session and navigate to the folder containing the python script
3. In PowerShell, execute `pyinstaller --onefile .\report_interation_extractor.py`
4. PyInstaller will create a build and dist dir like this one.  The dist dir should
   now contain the executable.
