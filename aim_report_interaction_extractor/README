Script Author: Matt Gracz
Initially developed for UW-Madison in Summer of 2024

-There is a python script in WiscWarehouse/aim-report-extractor that, when executed, will look for AiM server log files, load them, and extract information about how our users interact with AiM reports; for the purpose of clarity of I am dubbing that information "report interaction data".

-A single piece of “report interaction data” represents a single run of any report from the AiM web interface.  It has four fields: report ID, date, time, and timezone.  Together they represent when a given report was run, down to the second.

-The script does not extract *who* ran the report.  That may be a feature in the future.

-The script persists the report interaction data in a CSV file, with the column values formatted to be easily placed into a MySQL 8.x database, i.e., UW-Madison's data warehouse.

-Because this extracts info from server log files, this obviously will not detect users running reports from e.g., a Google Looker link or in Power BI, etc…  But it will catch any report run from the AiM web interface, BIRT, IQ, or otherwise.

-The regex_explanation.txt file is an English breakdown of how the most complicated part of the script works.

-Full documentation and to-do list is here:
