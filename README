::: AiM Report Interaction ETL Tool :::
Script Author: Matt Gracz
Initially developed for UW-Madison in Spring of 2024

-There is a python script in WiscWarehouse/aim-report-extractor that, when executed, will look for AiM log files, load them, and extract report interaction data from them.

-A single instance of a piece of “report interaction data” represents a single run of any report from the AiM web interface.  It has 4 columns: report ID, date, time, and timezone.  Together they represent when a given report was run, down to the second.

-The ETL process then persists the report interaction data in a CSV file, with the column values formatted to be easily placed into a MySQL 8.x database, i.e., our data warehouse.

-Because this extracts info from server log files, this obviously will not detect users running reports from e.g., a Google Looker link or in Power BI, etc…  But it will catch any report run from the AiM web interface, BIRT, IQ, or otherwise.
